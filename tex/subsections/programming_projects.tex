\section{Projects}
\subsection{Educational Haskell YouTube Videos}{}{July 2024 - Present}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create frequent educational videos from my passion of programming in Haskell
    \item Cultivated an online community by responding to viewers' questions and to foster a deeper undertanding of functional programming
\end{itemize}
\subsection{A Level Physics Simulator and Formula Calculator}{}{September 2022 - May 2023}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Achieved full marks by building a particle physics simulation program using simple SUVAT to create animations and Verlet integration methods to simulate rigid body physics
    \item The program computes and displays various simulations and visualisations for my peers to view and interact with, so improving their ability to learn
    \item Created entire UI and Menu System Framework from scratch with only Pygame; custom button types created included: toggle buttons, text input boxes, resizable buttons, sliding buttons
    \item Built with Python and Pygame
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Conway's Game of Life Visualiation}{}{January 2021 - April 2021}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Full visual recreation of Conway's Game of Life with Python and Pygame using Object Oriented Design principals
    \item The project's codebase was forked by an external developer to create an indepedent but heavily inspired project which demonstrates the impact and adaptability of my work
\end{itemize}
